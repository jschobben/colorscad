## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2021-06-27
### Fixed
3mfmerge:
- No need to manually install lib3mf anymore: now it's fetched as source (2.1.1), and compiled as part of the build.
- Raise CMake requirement to 3.14
colorscad:
- Improved OSX compatibility (thanks: Matt N.)

## [0.1.0] - 2020-02-19
### Added
- Add 3MF support, via lib3mf and the (included) c++ tool '3mfmerge'
- CLI interface: now need to explicitly specify output file name
### Fixed
- Mention OpenSCAD version requirements in README.md
- Do not automatically compress AMF files, since some tools (i.e. Slic3r 1.3.0) don't support compressed ones.
  Instead, just echo a one-liner that can be copy-pasted in the terminal to compress the AMF.
- More robust/verbose wrt failures, i.e. due to non-manifold geometry in the OpenSCAD model.
- Improved status output: better progress, and less noise if all goes well.

## [0.0.1] - 2020-02-16
### Added
- Everything! Only supports creating a colored .amf file.
