ColorSCAD
=========
This script helps with exporting an OpenSCAD model to AMF or 3MF format, with color information preserved.
The colors are simply assigned using OpenSCAD's color() statement, so generally speaking the output will look like the
preview (F5) view in OpenSCAD.

Requirements
------------
This script requires the Bash shell, and of course OpenSCAD.
AMF export should work with OpenSCAD version 2015.03, but was mostly tested on 2019.05.
3MF export requires version 2019.05 or newer, and also requires some preparation steps (compilation).

Platform-wise, it should run anywhere Bash runs (that includes i.e. cygwin) as long as GNU utilities are available on the path (macOS users should `brew install coreutils`).
No assumptions are made about OS-specific directories, such as /tmp/ and the like.
The platform-native OpenSCAD binary does have to be reachable via the PATH,
which means on Windows users may need to first run something like:
```export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/OpenSCAD:$PATH```.
It hasn't been verified yet whether it works on Bash 3 (i.e. Mac's non-Homebrew default).

Usage
-----
```./colorscad.sh -i <input scad file> -o <output file> [OTHER OPTIONS...] [-- OPENSCAD OPTIONS...]```

The output file must have as extension either '.amf' or '.3mf'.
For more detailed usage info that lists all the options, run `./colorscad.sh -h`.

How it works
------------
First, the model is analysed to find out which colors (RGBA values) it uses.
Then, OpenSCAD is used to generate an intermediate .amf or .3mf file for each color,
containing only geometry with that color.
Finally, all per-color intermediate files are combined, with color info added.

Or, in a bit more detail:
1) Convert the model to .csg format, mostly to resolve the various ways color() can be used into r/g/b/a parameters.
2) Call OpenSCAD to export a .stl, but redefine the color() module to echo its parameters and do nothing else.
3) Check that the produced .stl is empty; if not, complain about it and stubbornly refuse to continue.
4) Loop over the captured set of r/g/b/a values. For each of them, call OpenSCAD with another redefined color() module
   that only outputs when its r/g/b/a parameters match. Use multiple OpenSCAD processes here to speed things up a bit.
5) Combine all the individual intermediate files, assigning material color.

Preparations
------------
There is no need to make any ColorSCAD-specific changes to your .scad file(s), however they do need to follow these rules:
1) All geometry has a color assigned.
   Geometry without a color would end up having *every other* color assigned. The script detects this case though, and refuses to run.
2) No geometry has multiple colors assigned.
   Such geometry will not appear at all in the output. The script does not detect this (yet).
3) Don't use too many colors, or be prepared to have a lot of patience.
   No fancy gradients, please.
4) Let's avoid weird geometry such as overlapping color volumes...

To export a 3MF file, the lib3mf library is needed, and the c++ '3mfmerge' tool using it first needs to be compiled.
See [3mfmerge/README.md](3mfmerge/README.md).

Limitations
-----------
The .amf merging method is, hmm, a bit creative. The produced .amf should probably be one "object with multiple colored
volumes", but instead it contains a separate object for each color. Reason: lazy shell-script .amf merge
implementation is too slow to renumber vertices, which is needed for "single object with multiple volumes" format.

Merging .3mf files uses the official library for it,
although this means having a dependency which is not (yet) commonly available in all Linux distributions.

When there are a lot of colors, on Windows this script runs much slower than on Linux
(probably due to process creation costs).

Importing some files (such as .stl geometry) might not work.

Probably some weird output may be produced if color volumes overlap.

In fact, weird behavior may occur at any time! More testing is needed.
If it doesn't seem to work for your .scad for any non-obvious reason, let's hear about it.
